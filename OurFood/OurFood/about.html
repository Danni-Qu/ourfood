            This application was created by students for students. During this global pandemic, students have had to face numerous extraneous hardships. With OurFood, fueling their bodies does not have to be one of them. 
            <br>
            <br>
            OurFood is a website application in which students can list the ingredients they have and receive recipe suggestions as a result. With the current stay-at-home nature in mind, this app encourages young adults to be resourceful and scrape together food items they have instead of purchasing more or going out to eat. This will in turn save them money, promote healthier diets, decrease food waste contribution, and expose students to new recipes!
