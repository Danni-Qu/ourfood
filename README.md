# Welcome to OurFood!

## Inspiration
>Our team loves food and we want to help other students who love food too. We recognized the difficulties surrounding food during the COVID pandemic that can easily be eliminated with an application.

## What it does
>OurFood is a website application in which a student can list the ingredients they have and receive recipe suggestions as a result. The student can then scroll through recipe suggestions and choose one they like based on preference for cook time and recipe photo. This will send them to the website of the recipe where they can learn more and get cooking!

## How we built it
>Our team used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front end web development. We used Python for back-end work, alongside PyMongo to connect to the MongoDB. We also used Flask for developing the web application, and Google App Engine as our cloud computing platform.

## Challenges we ran into
>Our team faced quite a few challenges. We at first attempted using Firebase as our database, however we ran into issues collecting substrings. So after many attempts we ended up switching over to MongoDB. None of the team members had previously worked with JavaScript, so we had to learn that from scratch to incorporate it into our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
>Our team is incredibly proud of our project! We are happy to have been able to simultaneously work on front and back-end of this website application and then successfully be able to link them together and function properly.

## What we learned
>This project was a great learning experience for all of us. We learned important skills in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for the front end part, as well as Python and Flask for the back-end, and how to incorporate PyMongo, MongoDB and Google App Engine!

## What's next for OurFood
>OurFood can take many different paths in its future to become a better, more relevant application. We would like to see more features implemented, with perhaps the recipe showing on a separate page of our site. Some next steps would be to allow the user to have advanced settings when entering a list of ingredients. This would allow for preferences of dietary restrictions. It would also be nice to allow users to create an account and therefore be able to track their recipe choices.
